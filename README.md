This project is part of my web development internship program, focused on enhancing my skills in responsive design, JavaScript interactivity, and real-time data fetching using APIs.

Objectives:
Responsive Design: Ensured that the web pages look great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices using media queries.
Interactive Quiz/Image Carousel: Developed an engaging quiz and image carousel using JavaScript for dynamic content updates.
